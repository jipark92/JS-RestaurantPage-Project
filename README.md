# JS-RestaurantPage-Project


For this restaurant page, I will be working with javascript to write the html. html page will be blank. This will be a fun project as I always wanted to build some sort of restaurant website.  This project will focus on using tabs to switch between home, menu, and contact pages. only one page will display when a button is clicked on.  Most importantly, this project is to help me practice using webpack. bundling my codes then importing and exporting in among other files.
